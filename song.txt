Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
Because I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart
My life right from the start
I need a home, sweet home
To call my own

It was you
That told me I could do this
You put the music in my heart
And how you sang with the band in Memphis
It's hard just to be strong
Not knowing if I've done you proud
I like to imagine
You smile when you hear my songs

Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
Because I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart
My life right from the start
I need a home, sweet home
To call my own
